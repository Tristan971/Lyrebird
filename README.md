## Reasoning :
There are currently no effective Twitter clients on Windows and Linux.
The goal of Lyrebird is to fix this, support macOS, and remain fully open-source.

Hopefully this works out.


## How to get it

### [Precompiled](https://github.com/Tristan971/Lyrebird/releases)
Recommendations :

- Windows & macOS : download according [precompiled release](https://github.com/Tristan971/Lyrebird/releases).

- Debian/Ubuntu (& derivatives that use dpkg/apt) :
Add repository source `deb https://deb.lyrebird.moe any main`, then download signing key and add it to apt keyring
```bash
wget https://deb.lyrebird.moe/lyrebird_repositories.gpg
sudo apt-key add lyrebird_repositories.gpg
rm lyrebird_repositories.gpg
```
Then install latest version with `apt update && apt install lyrebird`.

- RedHat/CentOS/Fedora (& derivatives that use yum/dnf/rpm) :
Add repository source (unsure if gpgcheck=0 is needed as I sign rpm packets, but doesn't hurt)
```
[Lyrebird]
name=Lyrebird releases
baseurl=https://rpm.lyrebird.moe
gpgcheck=0
```
Then update your repositories and install package `lyrebird`.

### Build it yourself

Requirements:
- A Java 10+ development kit with JavaFX components included (i.e. an Oracle JDK or an OpenJDK+OpenJFX combo)
- Apache Maven (works at least with version 3.5.2)
- For native images you need either InnoSetup tools on Windows or ``dpkg-deb``/``rpmutils`` on Linux depending on
what system you want to target. You can only build native images for the current system type.

First (in project folder) : ``$> mvn clean install -DskipTests``

Then any of the following (in `Lyrebird/lyrebird` folder):
- Execute only (no packaging) : ``$> mvn spring-boot:run``
- For a native installer (will be in ``Lyrebird/lyrebird/target/jfx/native``) : ``$> mvn jfx:native -DskipTests``
- For a portable JAR file (will be in ``Lyrebird/lyrebird/target``) : ``$> mvn package -DskipTests``

## Can I contribute?
Please do!

It should be fairly easy to understand the general idea of the back-end model for any
seasoned Java developer with some Spring Framework experience.

For the UI/JavaFX model a lot of the work is delegated to a JavaFX framework called
EasyFXML which you can read about [here](https://github.com/Tristan971/EasyFXML).
